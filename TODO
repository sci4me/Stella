 - Vertex Array Object abstraction
   - Ability to attach VBOs, IBOs, etc.
     - Probably using their own abstractions
       - Which themselves use the Buffer_Builder
   - Ability to specify vertex format
     - Just an array of sizes and types, essentially 
   - Ability to "set" the data as well as "update" it
     - "set" and "update" mean `glBufferData` or `glBufferSubData`
       - Also need to be able to specify `GL_STATIC_DRAW` vs `GL_DYNAMIC_DRAW`
 - Framebuffer abstraction
   - "Just a wrapper" for OpenGL framebuffers
     - Ability to create and destroy them
     - Ability to bind and unbind them
     - Ability to configure what buffers/textures are attached to the FBO
       - i.e.  attach a texture to `GL_COLOR_ATTACHMENT0`
 - Logging !!!
   - Configurable (?)
   - Console Logging
   - File Logging
   - printf style API
 - Combine `batch` and `chunk` shaders?
   - Maybe not; I'm not sure if this is a good idea or not
     - Maybe it will be in the short term but we'll have to change it later on anyway?
     - Maybe we can just use a single shader and just pass it the data it needs to handle the cases instead of using multiple shaders?
       - Definitely not once we start doing less-than-trivial things
         - Lighting
         - OpenGL in ImGui
   - So, yeah uhm, maybe don't combine them? I don't even know.
